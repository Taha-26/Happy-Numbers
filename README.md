# Happy Numbers
A Python script to determine whether a given positive integer is a **Happy Number**.
---
## Overview

A **Happy Number** is defined by the following process:
1. Start with any positive integer.
2. Replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
3. Repeat the process until the number equals `1` (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include `1`.

Numbers that successfully reach `1` are classified as **Happy Numbers**, while others are considered unhappy (or sad) numbers.
